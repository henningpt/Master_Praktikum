The aim of the experiment is to record the absoptionspectrum
of rubidum. Therefor a diode laser is adjusted and aimed towards a cell
filled with rubidum.
The following part introduce the theory
important for the understanding of the experiment.

\subsection{Semiconductor}
\label{subsec:Semiconductor}

The diode laser is a result of the reseaching done on semiconductor.
So first a deep under
p and n together
